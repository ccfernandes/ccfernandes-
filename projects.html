            <h1>RiverNet Sensor Package</h1>
            <h2>Project overview: </h2>
            <p>This project was completed during my research internship in the summer of 2019.
                The premise of the project was to build a sensor pod that could be deployed in the local Guadalupe river for a professor in the SCU Environmental Science dpt.
            </p>
            <p>The final product uses the Arduino Pro Mini and SD card shield to write data to a .CSV file. This is connected to sensors that record 
                temperature. The electrical components are then enclosed in a waterproof container that is disguised as a rock. 
            </p>

            <h2>Project components: </h2>
            <h3>Software: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An arduino file (.ino) that writes to an SD card at user-defined intervals (the project required readings to be taken once every hour) </li>
                <li>A sensor interface file (.hpp) that defines virtual functions, common between the different sensors</li>
                <li>A class for each sensor, that includes a readData() function to retrieve data from the sensor.</li>
            </ul>  
            <h3>Design Decisions: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>An Arduino Pro Mini was used instead of a Arduino Uno in order to reduce power consumption</li>
                <li>A sensor interface was implemented in order to make it easier to add more sensors in the future</li>
                <li>A sleep mode function using the SleepyPi2 library was made to take periodic readings</li>
            </ul>
